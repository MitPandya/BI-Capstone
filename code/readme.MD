# Yelp Dataset Analysis

## code instructions 
1 . Review sentiment and timeseries analysis 
To run sentiment analysis run `sentiment.py` which will take already trained logistic regression model named `lr_model.pkl` and run it on the reviews data. ( could not upload reviews.txt file since it is greater than 25 MB in size).
2. To run timeseries analysis on sentiment data, run `Sentiment_timeseries.ipynb`.
